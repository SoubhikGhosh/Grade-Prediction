# Grade-Prediction
The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Data structures and Algorithms (dsa) and Object Oriented Programming (oop). [originally (mat) and (por)]

We have classified these students into three categories, "good", "fair", and "poor", according to their final exam performance. Then we analyzed a few features that have significant influence on students' final performance, including Romantic Status, Alcohol Consumption, Parents Education Level, Frequency Of Going Out, Desire Of Higher Education and Living Area. Finally, leveraging avaiable features, we have created various machine learning models to predict students' final performance classification and have compared models performance based on one-out sample accuracy score.

Dataset that we used is available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#
